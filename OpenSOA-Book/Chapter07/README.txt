CHAPTER 7 PRE-REQUISITES
========================
- jBPM Eclipse Graphical Process Designer (instructions for installing
  are found in README.pdf at the top-level of the project directory). 
  This is required for both visually designing processes and packaging
  processes for deployment to the jBPM Console.
  
  
NOTE
====
Examples for this chapter should be be run through ant, as opposed to running
them directly through Eclipse without Ant. This is because, since a single 
project is used for all of the book examples, classpath issues can arise due to how
Eclipse automatically constructs classpaths. You can run the ant targets
through Eclipse's Ant view.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHAPTER 7 SAMPLES
==================================
1. Please look into the specific subdirectories which correspond to the 
   book sections. They will each contain a README.txt file that explains
   what the example does, and how to run it.
