Examples for Chapter 7, Section 1.4
===================================

This example demonstrates the use of beanshell scripts that are defined
within a process definition. In this example, look at the src/main/jpdl/beanshell
directory for the processdefinition.xml. To see the beanshell scripts being used,
look at the source (you can click on the source tab in the bottom-left corner
of the Eclipse jBPM Designer to view source). Then, look at the 
ScriptProcessTest.java jUnit test, which validates that the scripts
are being properly interpreted. 

To run the example, use the ant target beanshell.test.
