Examples for Chapter 7, Section 1.3
===================================

This example will demonstrate the use of exception handling within a running
business process. It will generate various exceptions throughout the lifecycle
of the process, and then use defined exception handlers to catch the
thrown errors.

To run the example, run the ant target exception.text. To get a better
understanding what is happening, look at the ExceptionProcessTest.java jUnit
test. It provides fairly detailed instructions about what is happening.
