Examples for Chapter 8, Section 5.4
===================================

This example illustrates the use of Esper windows. As the book
mentions, they are similar to user defined tables that can then
be populated with qualifying events. 

The jUnit test, EsperTest854, can be run through the ant script
basic.window.test. The Esper statements which are used to process
the events can be found in ProcessStartEnd.java.
