Examples for Chapter 3, Section 2.4
===================================

To run the examples, do the following:

1) Open up a command window and change directory to this location.

2) Run the ant problem.ticket.server to run the domain which hosts the 
   ProblemTicketService.
   
3) You can test using soapUI. Run the ant target "run.soapui.gui". This 
   will launch soapUI, and you can use the project called "OpenSoa-03.2.4" 
   for testing.
   
Properties are the take-away from the examples in 3.2.4. In the book
I demonstrate several ways in which properties can be assigned. The 
problemMgmt.composite folder illustrates the various ways. However,
since I show several alternative ways to use properties, some 
of the methods are commented out.
