CHAPTER 3 EXAMPLES
==================

Please read the README.txt file located in each section's subdirectory
(for example, 3.2.2Components). 

Also, each of the examples for chapters 3 & 4 have a soapUI project
setup for testing (download soapUI at: http://www.soapui.org). 
The soapUI directory associated with each section contains the
XML project file that you can import into soapUI.
