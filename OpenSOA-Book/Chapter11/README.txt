Examples for Chapter 11
=======================

The examples for both chapters 11 & 12 were setup with the Drools 5.0CR1 
release. There are a lot of new features in the 5.0 release, and being
that is so near release, using this version was preferably than using
4.0.

When the 5.0 version is released, I will update the ivy scripts 
accordingly to pull down the latest version.

Please see the README.txt files in each of the subdirectories 
for instructions on running each sections examples.
