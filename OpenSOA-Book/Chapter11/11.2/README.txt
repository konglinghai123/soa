Examples for Chapter 11, Section 11.2
=====================================
These examples demonstrate some very basic rule functionality.

To run the examples, do the following:

1) Open up a command window and change directory to this location.

2) Run ant target "run.test" through the command window (or 
   through Eclipse, which in this case is fine).  
   
Please look at section 11.2 in the book for a more 
detailed explanation.

Note: These examples also show how the global variable mechanism
works, as we use it for the jUnit testing. Globals are talked about
in section 11.4.
