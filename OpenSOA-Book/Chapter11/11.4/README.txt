Examples for Chapter 11, Section 11.4
=====================================
These examples demonstrate some of what I'm calling the 
header options available when defining rules. Several
of the headers were actually used in the examples
from 11.2, such as import and global. The 
only additional one showed here is how functions
can be used.

To run the examples, do the following:

1) Open up a command window and change directory to this location.

2) Run ant target "run.test" through the command window (or 
   through Eclipse, which in this case is fine).  
   
Please look at section 11.4 in the book for a more 
detailed explanation.
